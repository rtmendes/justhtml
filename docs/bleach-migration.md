# Migrating from Bleach

JustHTML’s sanitization and transform pipeline were heavily inspired by Bleach’s real-world ergonomics.

Bleach has helped a lot of projects ship safer HTML over the years, and a lot of that is thanks to the hard work of [@willkg](https://github.com/willkg) building and maintaining it.

In 2023, Bleach’s maintainer announced that **Bleach is deprecated** (but will continue to receive security updates, new Python version support, and fixes for egregious bugs). See: https://github.com/mozilla/bleach/issues/698

This guide covers common migration patterns.

## Mental model differences

- Bleach takes a string and returns a cleaned string.
- JustHTML parses into a DOM and sanitizes by default at construction time:
    - `JustHTML(html)` sanitizes by default (`sanitize=True`).
    - `JustHTML(html, sanitize=False)` disables sanitization (trusted input only). (`safe` is a backwards-compatible alias.)

JustHTML also supports constructor-time **transforms** (a DOM equivalent of Bleach/html5lib filter pipelines): see [Transforms](transforms.md).

## Equivalent of `bleach.clean(...)`

A typical Bleach call:

```python
import bleach

clean = bleach.clean(
    user_html,
    tags=["p", "b", "a"],
    attributes={"a": ["href"]},
    protocols=["http", "https"],
    strip=True,
)
```

In JustHTML you typically configure a `SanitizationPolicy`:

```python
from justhtml import JustHTML, SanitizationPolicy, UrlPolicy, UrlRule

policy = SanitizationPolicy(
    allowed_tags=["p", "b", "a"],
    allowed_attributes={"*": [], "a": ["href"]},
    url_policy=UrlPolicy(
        default_handling="strip",
        allow_rules={
            ("a", "href"): UrlRule(allowed_schemes=["http", "https"]),
        },
    ),
)

doc = JustHTML(user_html, fragment=True, policy=policy)
clean = doc.to_html()
```

Notes:

- Prefer `fragment=True` for user-generated snippets. That avoids adding `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- JustHTML sanitizes *at construction time* by default. If you need to sanitize again after later DOM edits, add `Sanitize(...)` at the end of your transform pipeline (see [HTML Cleaning](html-cleaning.md)).

## Bleach filters → JustHTML transforms

Bleach supports html5lib filters and helper utilities (like linkifying text).

In JustHTML, you compose transforms (applied once, right after parsing):

- `bleach.linkify(...)` → `Linkify(...)` (see [Linkify](linkify.md))
- `html5lib.filters.whitespace.Filter` → `CollapseWhitespace(...)`
- "Strip tag but keep contents" → `Unwrap(selector)`
- "Drop tag and contents" → `Drop(selector)`
- "Remove children" → `Empty(selector)`
- "Set attributes" → `SetAttrs(selector, **attrs)`
- "Custom rewrite" → `Edit(selector, func)`

Example: linkify text, then add safe link attributes:

```python
from justhtml import JustHTML, Linkify, SetAttrs

doc = JustHTML(
    "<p>See example.com</p>",
    fragment=True,
    transforms=[
        Linkify(),
        SetAttrs("a", rel="nofollow noopener", target="_blank"),
    ],
)

# Still sanitized by default (construction time)
print(doc.to_html(pretty=False))
```

## URLs and protocols

Bleach’s `protocols=[...]` concept maps to JustHTML’s URL policy rules.

- Configure allowed schemes per attribute via `UrlRule(allowed_schemes=[...])`.
- Under `sanitize=True`, URLs can be rewritten or stripped according to policy (see [URL Cleaning](url-cleaning.md)).

## What to do with “strip=True/False”

Bleach’s `strip` option controls whether disallowed tags are removed entirely or escaped.

JustHTML’s sanitizer is allowlist-based and focuses on producing safe markup. Disallowed tags are handled by `SanitizationPolicy(disallowed_tag_handling=...)`, and dangerous containers (like `script`/`style`) drop their contents.

Mapping:

- Bleach `strip=True` → `disallowed_tag_handling="unwrap"` (default)
    - The disallowed tag is removed, but its children are kept (and sanitized).
- Bleach `strip=False` → `disallowed_tag_handling="escape"`
    - The disallowed tag’s start/end tags are emitted as text (escaped), and its children are kept (and sanitized).

JustHTML also supports `disallowed_tag_handling="drop"` to drop the entire disallowed subtree.

If you need to display untrusted HTML with no HTML in the output, prefer `to_text()`, or escape the output before embedding it into an HTML page. `to_markdown()` runs on the sanitized DOM when `sanitize=True` (the default), but it may still include sanitized raw HTML for elements such as tables and images.

If you need additional structural cleanup beyond policy decisions, prefer doing it explicitly with transforms.

## Suggested migration approach

1. Start by using JustHTML’s default sanitizer (`JustHTML(...).to_html()`).
2. Add a `SanitizationPolicy` that matches your allowlist and URL requirements.
3. Add transforms to replace any Bleach filter/linkify behavior.
4. Add tests for your exact input corpus and output expectations (especially around URLs and allowed attributes).
